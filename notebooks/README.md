# Development notebooks

The notebooks linked below document development and testing of the lake model and web application.

 1. **[Basic plots]()**. This notebook generates based plots used as figures on the documentation website.

 2. **[Titration curves]()**. Developing idealised/typical relationships for converting changes in Ca-equivalent concentration to changes in pH.

 3. **[API example]()**. An illustration of the main features of the lake model, including basic testing.

 4. **[Simulating lakes in Agder (part 1)]()**. Extracting and compiling a dataset of historic liming activities in Agder.

 5. **[Simulating lakes in Agder (part 2)]()**. Comparing simulations from the lake model to historic liming data provided by Statsforvalteren i Agder.

 6. **[Omregningsfaktorer]()**. Comparing the performance of different lime products to a reference standard for lakes with varying characteristics.
