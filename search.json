    "text": "1 Types of lime\nLime types used for vassdragskalking are a mixture of calcium carbonate (\\(CaCO_3\\)) and magnesium carbonate (\\(MgCO_3\\)). Pure \\(CaCO_3\\) is commonly called limestone, whereas carbonate rocks with significant proportions of magnesium are called dolomite or dolomitic limestones.\nLime manufacturers will typically specify the proportion of calcium and magnesium carbonate in their products. For example, Microdol5 is reported as being 53.7% \\(CaCO_3\\) and 44.4% \\(MgCO_3\\) by mass (with 1.9% other impurities).\nIn terms of lake liming, magnesium carbonate has a slightly larger effect on pH than calcium carbonate, so when comparing limes with different compositions it is usual to multiply the magnesium proportion by a factor of 1.187. This gives an effective *neutralising value** (NV), estimated as the sum of calcium carbonate equivalents (Table 1).\n\n\nTable 1: Estimating the neutralising value (NV) for two different lime products by converting the \\(MgCO3\\) content to \\(CaCO3\\)-equivalents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nMicrodol5\nVK3\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\nCaCO3 (%)\n   53.7\n   99.0\n\n\nMagnesium| MgCO3 (%) | CaCO3-ekv (%)\n   44.4\n   52.7\n    1.0\n    1.2\n\n\nNV (sum CaCo3-ekv; %)\n  106.4\n  100.2\n\n\n\n\nIf all the lime added to a waterbody dissolved completely, lime products with a higher NV would be more effective at increasing lake pH. However, solubility factors must also be considered - see the Column tests page for details."

    "text": "2 Relationships between Ca and pH\nA simple empirical relationship between pH and expected change in calcium concentration is given in Equation 1\n\\[\npH = pH_0 + A_{pH} log(\\delta Ca)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(pH\\) is the expected pH after liming; \\(pH_0\\) and \\(A_{pH}\\) are constants determined by lake properties; and \\(\\delta Ca\\) is the change in calcium concentration due to liming expressed in \\(\\mu ekv/l\\) (i.e. micro-moles of charge).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe need to check this equation, as its physical interpretation seems questionable: it only makes sense for \\(\\delta Ca \\geq 1\\), otherwise adding smaller amount of Ca actually reduces the pH. Furthermore, if \\(\\delta Ca\\) is zero, the result is undefined (whereas I would expect the change in pH in this case to be zero and for \\(pH_0\\) to reflect the pH before liming. This does not seem to be the case).\n\n\nFor any given lake, if detailed measurements of pH and calcium concentration are available before and after liming, the parameters \\(pH_0\\) and \\(A_{pH}\\) can be estimated from Equation 1 using linear regression. If measured data series are not available, the TPKALK report suggests default values based on water colour and pH before liming (Table 2). TPKALK also limits user-supplied values of \\(pH_0\\) to lie in the range 0 to 6, and \\(A_{pH}\\) to be in the range from 0 to 3.\n\n\nTable 2: Suggested values for the parameters \\(pH_0\\) and \\(A_{pH}\\) for lakes with different initial water chemistry (pH and colour).

    "section": "3 Effects of overdosing",
    "text": "3 Effects of overdosing\nIf large amounts of lime are added to a lake at one time, the overall effect on pH is usually less than might be achieved if smaller amounts were added more regularly. This is because, at high does, pH and calcium concentration increase in the immediate vicinity of the lime particles, which then sink to the lake bottom without dissolving efficiently. It is also more likely that lime particle will clump together and sink more rapidly.\nThe reduced effectiveness of high lime doses is called overdosing and it can be quantified using overdosing tests (see the Column tests page for details). For each lime type, these tests yield a set of overdosing factors like the example here, for a lime product called Miljøkalk EY3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverdosing example\n\n\n\nConsider a lake with a volume of 1 000 000 \\(m^3\\) that has 50 tonnes of Miljøkalk EY3 added. If all the lime dissolves completely, this corresponds to 50 \\(g/m^3\\) or 50 mg/l of lime. Based on the figure here, the overdosing factor for this lime at 50 mg/l is 2.2. Furthermore, the calcium content of this lime reported by the manufacturer is 38.5 %. We therefore expect the liming operation to change the concentration of calcium in the lake by \\(0.385 * 50 / 2.2 = 8.75\\) mg/l, which corresponds to \\(\\delta Ca = 437.5 \\ \\mu ekv/l\\). If the values for \\(pH_0\\) and \\(A_{pH}\\) for the lake are known (see Section 2), this \\(\\delta Ca\\) can be used in Equation 1 to estimate the pH after liming."

Each column is initially filled with 57.9 litres of deionised water containing 0.01% KCl, adjusted to the desired pH using sulphuric acid.\nFor each lime tested, the supplier must specify the typical proportion of Ca (by mass) in their product, \\(F_{Ca}\\).

If this dissolves completely and mixes evenly in the column (which in general it does not), this corresponds to uniform concentrations of 10 mg/l of lime and \\(10 F_{Ca}\\) mg/l of Ca. In this case, the total mass of Ca dissolved in the column between depths \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) (where \\(x_2 > x_1\\)) is given by\n\\[\nM_{Ca} = 10 F_{Ca} A (x_2 - x_1)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area of the column.\nIn practice, not all the lime dissolves and the columns do not equilibrate to uniform concentrations. After 16 hours, the concentration of Ca in each column is determined at different depths using ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometry). Measurements are taken every 40 cm from the surface down to 2 m - a total of six measurements. A typical dataset for a single column is shown in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1: Example data for a single column from the instantaneous dissolution test.\n\n\nColumn\npH\nDepth_m\nCa_mg/l\n\n\n\n\nA\n4.0\n0.0\n2.82\n\n\nA\n4.0\n0.4\n2.62\n\n\nA\n4.0\n0.8\n2.64\n\n\nA\n4.0\n1.2\n2.76\n\n\nA\n4.0\n1.6\n2.81\n\n\nA\n4.0\n2.0\n2.71\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 is used to estimate the total amount of Ca that has dissolved in each column after 16 hours. It is assumed that each column is horizontally well-mixed and that concentrations only vary with depth, \\(x\\). The total amount of Ca between depths \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) is therefore given by the integral\n\\[\nM_{Ca} = A \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} C(x) \\ dx\n\\tag{2}\\]\nFurthermore, the overall proportion of the available Ca that has dissolved, called the instantaneous dissolution, is obtained by dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, both evaluated over the entire column (typically from 0 to 2 m depth)\n\\[\nD_{inst} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{2} C(x) \\ dx}{10 F_{Ca} (2 - 0)}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nThe integral in Equation 3 can be approximated from the measured data using either Simpson’s rule or the trapezoidal rule (by default, the application uses the trapezoidal rule).\nThe main output from the instantaneous dissolution test is a characteristic curve showing the dissolution proportion at each pH value (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Instantaneous dissolution curve for different values of pH."
