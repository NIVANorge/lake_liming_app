    "text": "1 Types of lime\nLime products used for catchment management are usually a mixture of calcium carbonate (calcite, \\(CaCO_3\\)) and magnesium carbonate (\\(MgCO_3\\)). Rocks composed primarily of \\(CaCO_3\\) are commonly called limestones, whereas carbonate rocks with significant proportions of magnesium are called dolomites or dolomitic limestones.\nLime manufacturers will typically specify the proportion of calcium and magnesium carbonate in their products. For example, Microdol5 is reported as being 53.7% \\(CaCO_3\\) and 44.4% \\(MgCO_3\\) by mass (with 1.9% other impurities).\nMagnesium carbonate has a higher acid neutralising capacity (ANC) than calcium carbonate: 1 g of magnesium carbonate will neutralise as much acid as 1.19 g of calcium carbonate. When comparing limes with different compositions, it is therefore common to multiply the magnesium carbonate proportion by a factor of 1.19. This gives a total neutralising value (TNV), estimated as the sum of calcium carbonate equivalents (e.g. Table 1).\n\n\nTable 1: Estimating the total neutralising value (TNV) for two lime products. \\(MgCO_3\\) content is converted to \\(CaCO_3\\)-equivalents by multiplying by 1.19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nMicrodol5\nVK3\n\n\n\n\nCalcium\n\nCaCO3 (%)\n\n   53.7\n99.0\n\n\nMagnesium\n\nMgCO3 (%)\nCaCO3-ekv (%)\n\n   44.4\n   52.8\n1.0\n1.2\n\n\nTNV (sum of CaCO3-ekv; %)\n  106.5\n100.2\n\n\n\n\nTNV is usually specified in percent: pure calcium carbonate has a TNV of 100 %, pure magnesium carbonate has a TNV of 119 %, and typical dolomite products have TNVs that are somewhere in between. Weight for weight, products with a higher TNV will be more effective at increasing pH, as long as all the lime dissolves. In practice, different limes exhibit different dissolution rates, which must also be accounted for."

    "text": "2 Lime solubility\nSeveral factors affect the dissolution rate of lime material added to a waterbody. These include:\n\nPhysical and chemical properties of the lime (crystal structure etc.).\nParticle size (i.e. fineness) of the lime material - smaller particles give a larger reaction surface and therefore dissolve faster.\nWater pH - more acidic lakes react with the lime more vigorously.\nApplication method (for example from a boat versus from a helicopter).\nAmount of lime added, usually called the dose. If large amounts of lime are added to a lake all at once, the overall effect on pH is less than might be achieved if smaller amounts were added more regularly. This is because, at high doses, pH and calcium concentration increase in the immediate vicinity of the lime particles, which then sink to the bottom without dissolving efficiently. It is also more likely that lime particles will clump together and sink more rapidly. This effect is called overdosing.\n\nMost commercial lime products are fine enough to dissolve effectively. For a given application method and lake pH, the goal is therefore to identify which lime product to use (i.e. which physical and chemical properties to select) and in what dose (to minimise the number of applications necessary, without excessive waste due to overdosing).\nLime dissolution rates and the effects of overdosing are determined experimentally - see the Column tests page for details."

    "section": "3 Relationships between Ca and pH",
    "text": "3 Relationships between Ca and pH\nA simple empirical relationship between pH and change in calcium concentration is given in Equation 1\n\\[\npH = pH_0 + A_{pH} log(\\Delta Ca)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(pH\\) is the expected pH after liming; \\(pH_0\\) and \\(A_{pH}\\) are constants determined by lake properties; and \\(\\Delta Ca\\) is the change in calcium concentration due to liming expressed in \\(\\mu ekv/l\\) (i.e. micro-moles of charge).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe need to check this equation, as its physical interpretation seems questionable: it only makes sense for \\(\\Delta Ca \\geq 1\\); adding smaller amounts of Ca than this actually reduces the pH. Furthermore, if \\(\\Delta Ca\\) is zero, the result is undefined, whereas I would expect the change in pH for this case to be zero and for \\(pH_0\\) to reflect the pH before liming. Wouldn’t it make more sense to either regress expected change in pH against change in Ca, or simply pH against Ca?\n\n\nFor any given lake, if detailed measurements of pH and calcium concentration are available before and after liming, the parameters \\(pH_0\\) and \\(A_{pH}\\) can be estimated from Equation 1 using linear regression. If measured data are not available, the TPKALK report suggests default values based on water colour and pH before liming (Table 2). TPKALK also constrains user-supplied values of \\(pH_0\\) to lie in the range 0 to 6, and \\(A_{pH}\\) to be in the range from 0 to 3.\n\n\nTable 2: Suggested values for the parameters \\(pH_0\\) and \\(A_{pH}\\) for lakes with different initial water chemistry (pH and colour).

Based on the figure here, the overdosing factor for this lime at 50 mg/l is 2.2, which means around \\(100 / 2.2 = 45.5 \\ %\\) of the lime will dissolve rapidly. Furthermore, the calcium content of this lime reported by the manufacturer is 38.5 %. We therefore expect the liming operation to change the concentration of calcium in the lake by \\(0.45 \\times 0.385 \\times 50 = 8.75\\) mg/l, which corresponds to \\(\\Delta Ca = 437.5 \\ \\mu ekv/l\\).\nUsing Table 2, for this lake \\(pH_0 = 3.5\\) and \\(A_{pH} = 1.5\\).

    "text": "4 Mass balance model\nThe example above is simplistic, since it ignores factors such as hydrology and the dissolution of lime accumulated on the lake bottom, which can have a significant effect on calcium concentrations in the water. It also only provides an estimate of the initial change in pH due to liming, and not the subsequent evolution of pH over time.\nThe original TPKALK model implemented a simple mass balance, where volume of water in the lake, \\(V\\), is assumed to remain constant (i.e. the inflow discharge is equal to the outflow discharge at all times). For this model, the rate of change of mass of Ca dissolved in the lake water, \\(\\frac{dM_{lake}}{dt}\\) is expressed as a mass balance of sources and sinks (Equation 2).\n\\[\n\\frac{dM_{lake}}{dt} = F_{in} + F_{dose} + F_{bunn} - F_{ut}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nWhere \\(F_{in}\\), the input flux of calcium, is equal to the inflow discharge, \\(Q\\), multiplied by the inflow concentration, \\(C_{in}\\); and the output flux, \\(F_{ut}\\), is the outflow discharge (also \\(Q\\), since \\(V\\) is assumed constant), multiplied by the lake concentration, \\(C_{lake}\\). Equation 2 can therefore be rewritten as\n\\[\n\\frac{dM_{lake}}{dt} = V \\frac{dC_{lake}}{dt} = Q C_{in} + F_{dose} + F_{bunn} - Q C_{ut}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nWhere \\(F_{dose}\\) is the flux of added lime that dissolves instantly (i.e. the instantaneous dissolution; see above), and \\(F_{bunn}\\) represents the slower dissolution flux from the remaining lime i.e. that which does not dissolve instantly, but instead accumulates on the lake bottom and dissolves over a longer period of time (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Box model for lake calcium concentration under the assumption of fixed water volume.\n\n\nIn the model, \\(F_{dose}\\) is added instantaneously to \\(C_{lake}\\), while the remainder of the calcium that does not dissolve accumulates as a store with initial concentration \\(B\\). The Ca contribution from lime on the lake bottom is assumed to decay exponentially through time\n\\[\nF_{bunn} = K_L B e^{-K_L t}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nWhere \\(K_L\\) is the “deaktiveringskoeffisient”, a constant controlling how fast lime on the lake bottom dissolves."

    "section": "1 Instantaneous dissolution",
    "text": "1 Instantaneous dissolution\nFor each type of lime, we would like to know the proportion that will dissolve “immediately” for a range of initial pH values and dose concentrations. The dose is usually expressed as a concentration in mg/l of lime i.e. the total mass of lime added, divided by the total volume of water in the column (or waterbody). If the dose concentration is \\(D \\ mg/l\\) of lime and the proportion of calcium in the lime product by mass is \\(F_{Ca}\\), then if all the lime dissolves completely the concetration of Ca in the column will be \\(F_{Ca} D \\ mg/l\\). The aim of the tests is to see how much of the lime actually dissolves under different conditions.\n\n1.1 Varying pH\nFor the first set of tests, columns A to E are adjusted to have pH values of 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 and 6, respectively. 0.579 g of dried lime are then added to the top of each column, corresponding to a uniform dose of 10 mg/l of lime. If all of this dissolves and mixes evenly, the total mass of Ca or Mg dissolved in the column between any two depths \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) (where \\(x_2 > x_1\\)) is given by\n\\[\nM_{par} = 10 F_{par} A (x_2 - x_1)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area of the column and \\(par\\) is either Ca or Mg.\nIn practice, not all the lime dissolves and the columns do not achieve uniform concentrations. After 16 hours, the concentration of Ca (and Mg, if relevant) in each column is determined at different depths using ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometry). Five measurements are taken from each column: every 40 cm from the surface down to 1.6 m. A typical dataset for a single column for a non-dolomitic lime (i.e. Ca only) is shown in Table 1.\n\n\nTable 1: Example data for a single column from the instantaneous dissolution test for calcium.\n\n\nColumn\npH\nDepth_m\nCa_mg/l\n\n\n\n\nA\n4.0\n0.0\n2.82\n\n\nA\n4.0\n0.4\n2.62\n\n\nA\n4.0\n0.8\n2.64\n\n\nA\n4.0\n1.2\n2.76\n\n\nA\n4.0\n1.6\n2.81\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 is used to estimate the total amount of Ca that has actually dissolved in each column after 16 hours. It is assumed that each column is horizontally well-mixed and that concentrations only vary with depth, \\(x\\). The total amount of Ca between depths \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) is given by the integral\n\\[\nM_{Ca} = A \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} C(x) \\ dx\n\\tag{2}\\]\nThe overall proportion of the available Ca that has dissolved, called the instantaneous dissolution, can then be obtained by dividing Equation 2 by Equation 1, both evaluated between 0 and 1.6 m depth (and the same calculation performed for magnesium, if relevant).\n\\[\nD_{inst} = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{2} C(x) \\ dx}{10 F_{Ca} (2 - 0)}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nThe integral in Equation 3 can be approximated from the measured data using e.g. Simpson’s rule or the trapezoidal rule. By default, the application uses the trapezoidal rule.\nThe main output from the first experiment is a set instantaneous dissolution values (usually expressed in percent) showing how the dissolution changes with initial pH at a fixed dose (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Instantaneous dissolution curve for varying pH (with dose fixed at 10 mg/l of lime).\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Varying dose\nIn the second experiment, columns A to E are fixed at pH 4.6 and different doses are added to each column, corresponding to lime concentrations of 10, 20, 35, 50 and 85 mg/l (assuming complete dissolution). The columns are again left to equilibrate for 16 hours and the instantaneous dissolution for each column is determined using the procedure described in Section 1.1.\n\n\n1.3 Combining datasets\nThe two experiments described in Section 1.1 and Section 1.2 yield data in the format shown in Table 2.\n\n\nTable 2: Experimental design for column tests. Each x coresponds to a single column for which instantaneous dissolution is determined.\n\n\npHDose\n4\n4.5\n5\n5.5\n6\n\n\n\n\n10\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\n\n\n20\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n85\n\nx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe overdosing factor is then calculated as the ratio \\(D_{10} / D_{x}\\), where \\(D_{10}\\) is the instantaneous dissolution for the column where 10 mg/l of lime was initially added, and \\(D_{x}\\) is the instantaneous dissolution for the column where \\(x\\) mg/l of lime was added.\nA typical curve for overdosing factors is shown in Figure 2.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Overdosing factors."
