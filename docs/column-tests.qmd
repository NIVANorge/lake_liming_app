The proportion of lime that will dissolve "immediately" can be estimated using **column tests** (in this case, the term "immediately" means "*within days*", rather than weeks, months or years). Each experiment involves 5 columns, labelled `A` to `E`. The columns are 19 cm in diameter and at least 205 cm high, and they are initially filled with 57.9 litres of deionised water containing 0.01% KCl, adjusted to the desired pH using sulphuric acid.

For each lime tested, the supplier must specify the typical proportions of Ca and Mg (by mass) in their product, $F_{Ca}$ and $F_{Mg}$. These fractions are used in the calculations below.

## Instantaneous dissolution {#sec-instant-dissolution}

For each type of lime, we would like to know the proportion that will dissolve "immediately" for a range of **initial pH values** and **dose concentrations**. The dose is usually expressed as a concentration in mg/l of lime i.e. the total mass of lime added, divided by the total volume of water in the column (or waterbody). If the dose concentration is $D \ mg/l$ of lime and the proportion of calcium in the lime product by mass is $F_{Ca}$, then if all the lime dissolves completely the concetration of Ca in the column will be $F_{Ca} D \ mg/l$. The aim of the tests is to see how much of the lime actually dissolves under different conditions.

### Varying pH {#sec-vary-ph}

For the first set of tests, columns `A` to `E` are adjusted to have pH values of 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5 and 6, respectively. 0.579 g of dried lime are then added to the top of each column, corresponding to a uniform **dose** of 10 mg/l of lime. If all of this dissolves and mixes evenly, the total mass of Ca or Mg dissolved in the column between any two depths $x_1$ and $x_2$ (where $x_2 > x_1$) is given by

$$
M_{par} = 10 F_{par} A (x_2 - x_1)
$$ {#eq-evenly-mixed}

where $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the column and $par$ is either Ca or Mg. 

In practice, not all the lime dissolves and the columns do not achieve uniform concentrations. After **16 hours**, the concentration of Ca (and Mg, if relevant) in each column is determined at different depths using ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Optical Emission Spectrometry). Five measurements are taken from each column: every 40 cm from the surface down to 1.6 m. A typical dataset for a single column for a non-dolomitic lime (i.e. Ca only) is shown in @tbl-instantaneous-dissolution.

| **Column** | **pH** | **Depth_m** | **Ca_mg/l** |
|:----------:|:------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|      A     |    4.0 |         0.0 |        2.82 |
|      A     |    4.0 |         0.4 |        2.62 |
|      A     |    4.0 |         0.8 |        2.64 |
|      A     |    4.0 |         1.2 |        2.76 |
|      A     |    4.0 |         1.6 |        2.81 |

@tbl-instantaneous-dissolution is used to estimate the total amount of Ca that has actually dissolved in each column after 16 hours. It is assumed that each column is horizontally well-mixed and that concentrations only vary with depth, $x$. The total amount of Ca between depths $x_1$ and $x_2$ is given by the integral

$$
M_{Ca} = A \int_{x_1}^{x_2} C(x) \ dx
$$ {#eq-conc-depth-integral}

The overall proportion of the available Ca that has dissolved, called the **instantaneous dissolution**, can then be obtained by dividing @eq-conc-depth-integral by @eq-evenly-mixed, both evaluated between 0 and 1.6 m depth (and the same calculation performed for magnesium, if relevant).

$$
D_{inst} = \frac{\int_{0}^{2} C(x) \ dx}{10 F_{Ca} (2 - 0)}
$$ {#eq-inst-diss}

The integral in @eq-inst-diss can be approximated from the measured data using e.g. [Simpson's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule) or the [trapezoidal rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule). By default, the application uses the trapezoidal rule.

The main output from the first experiment is a set instantaneous dissolution values (usually expressed in percent) showing how the **dissolution changes with initial pH at a fixed dose** (@fig-instantaneous-dissolution-curve).

### Varying dose {#sec-vary-dose}

In the second experiment, columns `A` to `E` are fixed at pH 4.6 and different doses are added to each column, corresponding to lime concentrations of 10, 20, 35, 50 and 85 mg/l (assuming complete dissolution). The columns are again left to equilibrate for **16 hours** and the **instantaneous dissolution** for each column is determined using the procedure described in @sec-vary-ph. 

### Combining datasets {#sec-combining}

The two experiments described in @sec-vary-ph and @sec-vary-dose yield data in the format shown in @tbl-expt-design. 

| **pH**<br>**Dose** | **4** | **4.5** | **5** | **5.5** | **6** |
|:------------------:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|
|       **10**       |   x   |    x    |   x   |    x    |   x   |
|       **20**       |       |    x    |       |         |       |
|       **35**       |       |    x    |       |         |       |
|       **50**       |       |    x    |       |         |       |
|       **85**       |       |    x    |       |         |       |

: Experimental design for column tests. Each `x` coresponds to a single column for which instantaneous dissolution is determined. {#tbl-expt-design}

The **overdosing factor** is then calculated as the ratio $D_{10} / D_{x}$, where $D_{10}$ is the instantaneous dissolution for the column where 10 mg/l of lime was initially added, and $D_{x}$ is the instantaneous dissolution for the column where $x$ mg/l of lime was added.

A typical curve for overdosing factors is shown in @fig-overdosing-curve.
