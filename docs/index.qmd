This website provides documentation for the liming application. 

The current pages are just placeholders (in English). 

## Overview {#sec-overview}

The application performs two kinds of calculation:

 1. **[Lake modelling](./lake-modelling.qmd)**. Estimate the amount of lime required to achieve a target change in pH (depending on the type of lime, lake characteristics and lime application method).

 2. **Summarising data from [column tests](./column-tests.qmd)**. Upload column test data using a standard template and calculate characteristic curves for **instantaneous dissolution** and **overdosing factor**.
