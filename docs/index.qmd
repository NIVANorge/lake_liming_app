This website provides documentation for the [lake liming application](https://lake-liming.t.niva.no/). The model aims to simulate typical/idealised responses of lake water chemistry (calcium concentration and pH) to various liming strategies.

 * For a description of how to use the application, see the [User guide](./user_guide.qmd).

 * To understand how the model works, see [Lake modelling](./lake_modelling.qmd).

 * For details of the empirical data used to represent different lime products, see [Column tests](./column_tests.qmd).
