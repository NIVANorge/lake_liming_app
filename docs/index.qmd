This website provides documentation for the [lake liming application](https://lake-liming.t.niva.no/). The model aims to simulate typical/idealised responses of lake water chemistry (calcium concentration and pH) to various liming strategies.

 * For a description of how to use the application, see the [User guide](https://nivanorge.github.io/lake_liming_app/user-guide.html).

 * To understand how the model works, see [Lake modelling](https://nivanorge.github.io/lake_liming_app/lake-modelling.html).

 * For details of the empirical data used to represent different lime products, see [Column tests](https://nivanorge.github.io/lake_liming_app/column-tests.html).

 * For technical details, see the [development notebooks](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app/tree/main/notebooks#development-notebooks). The model code is also Open Source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app).
