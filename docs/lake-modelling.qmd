The calculations performed by the application and described on this page are a subset of those implemented by the original [TPKALK application](https://niva.brage.unit.no/niva-xmlui/handle/11250/208709) developed by NIVA during the 1990s.

## Background {#sec-background}

### Types of liming material {#sec-lime-types}

Lime products used for catchment management are usually a mixture of **calcium carbonate** (calcite, $CaCO_3$) and **magnesium carbonate** ($MgCO_3$). Rocks composed primarily of $CaCO_3$ are commonly called **limestones** and **chalks**, whereas carbonate rocks with significant proportions of magnesium are called **dolomites** (> 10% Mg) or magnesian limestones (2 to 10% Mg).

Lime manufacturers will typically specify the proportion of calcium and magnesium carbonate in their products. For example, `Microdol5` is reported as being 53.7% $CaCO_3$ and 44.4% $MgCO_3$ by mass (with 1.9% other impurities).

Magnesium carbonate has a higher acid neutralising capacity (ANC) than calcium carbonate: 1 g of magnesium carbonate will neutralise as much acid as 1.19 g of calcium carbonate. When comparing limes with different compositions, it is therefore necessary to multiply the magnesium carbonate proportion by a factor of 1.19. This gives a **neutralising value (NV)**, estimated as the sum of calcium carbonate *equivalents* (e.g. @tbl-nv). The NV is best determined by titration according to EN-12945. It may also be estimated from Ca and Mg element analyses, but in some cases these elements may be fixed to minerals other than carbonates with little or no neutralising capacity.

The NV is usually specified in percent: pure calcium carbonate has a NV of 100 %; pure magnesium carbonate has a NV of 119 %; and typical dolomite products have NVs that are somewhere in between. For the same mass, products with a higher NV will be more effective at increasing pH, *as long as all the lime dissolves*. In practice, different limes exhibit different dissolution rates, which must also be accounted for (@sec-solubility).

### Lime solubility {#sec-solubility}

Several factors affect the dissolution rate of lime material added to a waterbody. These include:

 * **Physical** and **chemical** properties of the liming material (crystal structure etc.).

 * **Particle size** (i.e. fineness) of the lime material - smaller particles give a larger reaction surface and therefore dissolve faster.

 * **Water pH** - more acidic lakes react with the lime more vigorously.

 * **Application method** (for example from a boat versus from a helicopter).

 * Amount of lime added, usually called the **dose**. If large amounts of lime are added to a lake all at once, the overall effect on pH is less than might be achieved if smaller amounts were added more regularly. This is because, at high doses, pH and calcium concentration increase in the immediate vicinity of the lime particles, which then sink to the bottom without dissolving efficiently. It is also more likely that lime particles will clump together and sink more rapidly. This effect is called **overdosing**.

Most commercial lime products are fine enough to dissolve effectively. For a given application method and lake pH, the goal is therefore to identify **which lime product to use** (i.e. which physical and chemical properties to select) and **in what dose** (to minimise the number of applications necessary, without excessive waste due to overdosing). 

Lime dissolution rates and the effects of overdosing are determined experimentally - see the [column tests](./column-tests.qmd) page for details.

## Modelling procedure {#sec-modelling}

**The overall goal is to model changes in lake pH due to liming with different products**. The model should provide an evidence base to decide which lime products to apply under different circumstances.

### Relationship between Ca and pH {#sec-ca-ph}

When we add liming material, the concentration of CaCO3 (and MgCO3, if relevant) in the lake increases, which leads to an increase in pH. A simple empirical relationship between pH and change in calcium concentration is given in @eq-ph-ca

$$
pH = pH_0 + A_{pH} log(\Delta Ca)
$$ {#eq-ph-ca}

where $pH$ is the expected pH *after* liming; $pH_0$ and $A_{pH}$ are constants determined by lake chemistry; and $\Delta Ca$ is the change in calcium concentration due to liming expressed in $\mu ekv/l$ (i.e. micro-moles of charge).

::: {.callout-note}
**Questions:**

 * How do we account for Mg in this equation? Do we simulate $\Delta Mg$ and then convert to Ca-equivalents i.e. $pH = pH_0 + A_{pH} log⁡(\Delta Ca + 1.19 \Delta Mg)$, or something else?
 
 * In a previous e-mail, Karl-Jan wrote, "*Espen proposed that we should account for 0,5 mg/l Ca (+Mg) 1 year after liming. Hence, we should check the titration curve as given in TPKALK;  it ought to be adjusted*". Does this mean we should use a different equation to the one above? If so, what? Or does this comment relate to something else?

 * We need to check this equation, because it predicts that small additions of lime will *decrease* pH, and if $\Delta Ca = 0$ the result is undefined. It appears to be a version of the [Henderson-Hasselbalch equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson%E2%80%93Hasselbalch_equation#), but modified in a way that loses any physical interpretation. If this is the "titration curve" that Karl-Jan refers to, how do we make it better/more meaningful?
:::

For any given lake, if detailed measurements of pH and calcium concentration are available before and after liming, the parameters $pH_0$ and $A_{pH}$ can be estimated from @eq-ph-ca using linear regression. If measured data are not available, the [TPKALK report](https://niva.brage.unit.no/niva-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/208709/3412_200dpi.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y) suggests default values based on water colour and pH *before* liming (@tbl-ph0-aph). TPKALK also constrains user-supplied values of $pH_0$ to lie in the range 0 to 6, and $A_{pH}$ to be in the range from 0 to 3.

### Mass balance model {#sec-mass-bal-model}

@eq-ph-ca transforms the problem of modelling pH into one of modelling $\Delta Ca$ (and $\Delta Mg$ too, if relevant). When we add lime to a lake, some of it dissolves instantly, giving a sudden increase in pH, while the remainder sinks to the bottom and dissolves more slowly.

To provide an estimate of both the initial change in lake conditions due to liming and the subsequent evolution over time, the original TPKALK model implemented a mass balance "box model"(@fig-box-model) where:

 * $D$ is the dose of lime added (adjusted for Ca content i.e. the actual dose of Ca in mg/l)
 * $C_{inst}$ is the "immediate" increase in lake Ca concentration (in mg/l) due to **instantaneous dissolution**
 * $C_{bott} = F_{active} (D - C_{inst})$ is the amount of Ca (in mg/l) that sinks to the lake bottom and remains active for dissolution. Note that $(D - C_{inst})$ is the total amount of lime that sinks to the bottom, and $F_{active}$ is the proportion of this that remains "active". Typical values for $F_{active}$ are around 0.4, based on the observation that about 60% of the lime arriving on the lake bottom becomes "deactivated" and never dissolves.
 * $F_{slow}$ is the rate at which concentration increases (in mg/l/month) due to dissolution of the bottom layer
 * $C_{in}$ and $C_{out}$ are the inflow and outflow concentrations of Ca, respectively (both in mg/l)
 * $V$ is the lake volume in litres. The lake is assumed to be in **steady state** i.e. $V$ is constant
 * $Q$ is the discharge in l/month. To satisfy the steady state assumption, the inflow discharge must equal the outflow discharge
 * $M_{lake}$ is the mass of Ca dissolved in the lake water (in mg)
 * $C_{lake}$ is the Ca concentration in the lake, equal to $\frac{M_{lake}}{V}$. The lake is assumed to be **well mixed**, such that the outflow concentration, $C_{out}$, is equal to $C_{lake}$
 
![Schematic illustration of the TPKALK box model for lake calcium concentration for a single lake under the assumption of fixed water volume. Symbols are defined in the text.](./images/box_model.png){#fig-box-model}

Balancing the main sources and sinks of Ca to the lake gives

$$
\frac{dM_{lake}}{dt} = V \frac{dC_{lake}}{dt} = Q C_{in} - Q C_{lake} + V C_{inst} + V F_{slow}
$$ {#eq-dMlake_dt}

or

$$
\frac{dC_{lake}}{dt} = \frac{Q C_{in} - Q C_{lake}}{V} + C_{inst} + F_{slow}
$$ {#eq-dClake_dt}

The lime that sinks to the bottom and remains "active", $C_{bott}$, is assumed to dissolve quickly at first, then more slowly as time passes. TPKALK uses an exponential function to represent this slow dissolution effect

$$
F_{slow} = \frac{dC_{slow}}{dt} = C_{bott} K_L e^{-K_L t}
$$ {#eq-dCslow_dt}

The integral of the function $K_L exp(-K_L t)$ from zero to infinity is equal to 1. This functional form is chosen in order to conserve mass: the total amount of "active" lime on the bottom of the lake is enough to increase the lake concentration by $C_{bott}$ mg/l. Between any two time points, the function for $F_{slow}$ can be integrated to give a number between 0 and 1 representing the proportion of $C_{bott}$ that dissolves within the period. For periods soon after adding lime this proportion will be large, and it decays over time. However, because the total area under the curve is equal to one, the total amount of lime that dissolves from the bottom layer can never be greater than $C_{bott}$.

The parameter $K_L$ (units $month^{-1}$) is the "deaktiveringskoeffisient", a constant that controls how fast lime on the lake bottom dissolves (larger values mean faster dissolution).

An initial Python implementation of this model is [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app/blob/main/notebooks/box_model.ipynb).

### Estimating instantaneous dissolution {#sec-inst-diss}

For the model to produce reasonable simulations, it is important to have an accurate estimate for the proportion of lime material that dissolves quickly (i.e. the instantaneous dissolution fraction, $C_{inst}$). Instantaneous dissolution can be measured in the laboratory using [column tests](./column-tests.qmd), which tell us how much lime will typically dissolve in a 2 m (sometimes 5 m) column given a known initial pH and lime dose. However, before the column test data can be used for lake modelling, it is necessary to adjust for:

 * **Spreading method**. For dry spreading (e.g. by helicopter) the amount of lime material that dissolves immediately is typically 0.5 to 0.7 times the proportion predicted by column tests (see Sverdrup Table 3; Espen Enge used 0.8 for much of his work). No adjustment is required for wet spreading (e.g. from a boat).

 * **Lake depth**. Deeper lakes give the lime more time to dissolve as it sinks. The instantaneous dissolution for a lake of depth $d_{lake}$ and initial pH $X$ is assumed to be similar to the dissolution in a test column of depth $d_{col}$ with pH $(X - a)$ where

$$
a = m log⁡(\frac{d_{lake}}{d_{col}})
$$ {#eq-cor-depth}

and $m$ takes value 1 for Ca and 0.5 for Mg.

::: {.callout-note}
**Question:**
In Karl-Jan's e-mail, @eq-cor-depth is only defined for $d_{col} = 5 \ m$. Is it OK to generalise this for other column depths (e.g. 2 m) as I have done here, or is the relationship purely empirical and only tested for $d_{col} = 5 \ m$?
:::

### Simulating a "standard lake" {#sec-standard-lake}

The model defined above is capable of simulating how pH and Ca concentration (and Mg, if relevant) change over time for a single lake. The model requires the following iinputs:

 * $pH_0$ and $A_{pH}$ to define the relationship between Ca concentration and pH.

 * Lake **volume** (often provided as surface area and mean depth) and **discharge**, which together define the **residence time**. Note that this model assumes the volume is fixed, but discharge can vary over time, if desired.

 * **Initial pH and Ca concentration** for the lake, and the Ca concentration at the inflow (usually assumed equal to the concentration in the lake). Concentrations for Mg are also required, if relevant.

 * The **dose** of liming material added and the **proportion of Ca and Mg by mass** in the lime. The **overdosing factor** is also relevant for higher doses

 * **Lake mean depth** and **Spreading method** (i.e. "wet" or "dry"), both of which are used to adjust the instantaneous dissolution values from column tests (@eq-cor-depth).

 * **The fraction of the lime on the lake bottom that remains "active"** for dissolution over long time periods.

 * The parameter $K_L$ (for both Ca and Mg), which determines how fast "active" lime on the lake bottom dissolves.

To avoid having to specify all these parameters when comparing different lime products, it is common to consider a **standard lake** with a typical **discharge profile**.

::: {.callout-note}
**Questions regarding the standard lake proposed by Karl-Jan:**

From Karl-Jan's e-mails, the standard lake has the following properties:

 * **Area:** 20 ha. *OK.*

 * **Mean depth:** 5 m. *OK, but please see `discharge`, below.*

 * **Residence time:** 0.7 years. *OK, but please see `discharge`, below.*

 * **Discharge:** *If the three parameters above are fixed, then the discharge is pre-determined and must be held constant. However, it has also been suggested that we (i) should use a typical flow profile that varies by month, in which case the lake will also have a set of monthly residence times, and (ii) tune both the discharge and mean depth to achieve different residence times. In both these cases, it appears that mean depth and residence time are **not** fixed characteristics of the standard lake?*

 * **pH before liming:** 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0. *OK, but given the range of variation I suggest treating this as a variable rather than a "standard characteristic".*

 * **Desired pH change:** +1.5. *I'm not sure what is meant by this, since the pH will change over time. What does the +1.5 refer to? Is it the instantaneous dissolution effect, or the maximum change, or the change 1 year after liming, or something else?*

 * **Dosering:** 10 g/m3. *OK.*

 * **Nøytraliseringsbehov:** Justeres slik at kalkdosen blir 10 g/m3. *I'm not sure what this refers to. Aren't the neutralising needs defined by the desired pH change?*

 * **Andel av innsjøoverflate som kalkes:** 50%. *I'm not sure what effect this should have, since the "dose" is defined in mg/l based on the volume of the whole lake. In the context of TPKALK, what effect should this parameter have on the calculations?*

 * **CaCO3-ekv:** 107% (Microdol 5). *OK, but presumably this isn't a fixed parameter for the "standard lake", as I thought the main purpose was to compare different lime types?*

 * **Application method:** Wet spreading from boat. *OK.*

In addition, the following characteristics have not been mentioned yet in relation to the standard lake, but seem to be required by the model:

 * $pH_0$ and $A_{pH}$
 * **Initial Ca concentration** in the lake (and Mg, if relevant). Or are these estimated in some other way based on the characteristics specified above?

**Some additional initial comments from Atle:**

 > Harald Sverdrup har en likning som korrigerer for det, dvs. regner ut prosentvis oppløsning basert på kalktype, pH og synkedyp, så vidt jeg husker.

Is this the same equation as described above in @sec-inst-diss (@eq-cor-depth), or is Atle referring to an alternative? An equation that directly estimates the change in instantaneous dissolution would be more practical than @eq-cor-depth (which instead modifies the pH values used in a lookup table).

> Men løst organisk materiale krever også sitt for å oppnå ønsket pH. Jeg har laget titreringskurver (pH-tilsatt Ca) for ulike kons av TOC, slik at tilsatt kalkkons kan korrigeres.

This suggests there may be a better way of accounting for organic matter concentration than using $pH_0$ and $A_{pH}$ in @eq-ph-ca?

> Grunne innsjøer vil gjerne ha en større andel kalk som synker ned på bunnen. Siden kalk på bunnen vil inaktiveres over tid, er det bare noen få år bidraget kan regnes inn. Men vi har fulgt kalkede innsjøer etter kalkslutt og funnet at denne «halen» er betydelig lenger enn det ren fortynning (basert på teoretisk oppholdstid) skulle tilsi. Tror ikke det er data for å underbygge forskjeller i langtidsoppløsning mellom kalktyper – trolig temmelig uavhengig.

Based on this, it sounds as though we might be able to treat all lime products the same in terms of long-term dissolution? This could correspond to using single $F_{active}$ and $K_L$ values for all lime types, although this will also mean that medium term dissolution rates (i.e. the first lake-bottom lime to dissolve) will also be the same for all limes. Thoughts?
