# Lake liming app

A web application for simulating the effectiveness of lake liming using different lime products. Developed for Milj√∏direktoratet during 2023.

## 1. Background

An overview of the project and main development tasks can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app/wiki).

## 2. Streamlit app for testing

A simple Streamlit app to explore user requirements is deployed [here](https://lake-liming.t.niva.no/). Note that the final application will probably not be deployed using Streamlit, but it's useful as a starting point for discussions and for quickly exploring UI options.

To deploy new code, make sure to take note of the **image tag** created by the github action **Build & Push** and update this image tag in the [kustomization.yaml](https://github.com/NIVANorge/nivacloud-manifests/blob/59494ea5716753abef9ffe9d8cc5d8ef2a5db4c8/workloads/lake-liming-app/base/kustomization.yaml#L9) file in the nivacloud-manifests repository. Then, run the github action **Lake liming test deployment** in the nivacloud-manifests repository.

To deploy the app for testing via JupyterHub:

1.  Clone this repository to the Hub

2.  Open a terminal and `cd` into the `lake_liming_app` folder

3.  Run `streamlit run app.py` to start the app

4.  Open a new browser tab and navigate to https://hub.p.niva.no/hub/user-redirect/proxy/8501/ to view the app

## 3. Documentation

User documentation for the application is [here](https://nivanorge.github.io/lake_liming_app/).

### 3.1. Updating the documentation

The documentation is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Files are stored in the main repository within the `docs` sub-folder. To update the documentation, simply update the files in this folder and push your changes to `main`. This will trigger a GitHub "action" ([here](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app/blob/main/.github/workflows/quarto-publish.yml)) that will rebuild the website and publish a new version via GitHub-Pages.

## 4. Data templates

Blank data templates for use with the app are available [here](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app/tree/main/data). Templates containing example data for use when testing are also provided.

## 5. Contributing

Please use the [Discussions board](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app/discussions) for general questions & ideas, and the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app/issues) for specific suggestions (i.e. anything requiring a definite action or resolution). Further details about the project can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app/wiki) and in the [user-facing documentation](https://nivanorge.github.io/lake_liming_app/). All code relating to the project is [here](https://github.com/NIVANorge/lake_liming_app).
